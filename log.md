# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: March 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Concluded the HTML/HTML5 portion of the FreeCodeCamp and started the CSS portion.

**Thoughts:** I've touched HTML in the past but it was so long ago and I didn't have the kind of crystal clarity I have with it now. We went through really fast and it's the kind of thing where if I'm making my own page, I may have to reference some of the style guides as far as putting in the tags.

As far as CSS, I started adding different properties to my element and created classes. I just touched on creating ids, but will pick that up more tomorrow. I'm unsure as to what the use of IDs are compared to classes, and why I'd ever use IDs specifically.

Not sure if I can link the FCC stuff here, but I'll work on that.

### Day 3: March, 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I went through the intro at https://golang.org/doc/code.html and created a local Git repo on my Chromebook's linux CLI. I then pushed it to my actual Github. I created my workspace for Go, set my paths, and built a hello world program. I also created a reverse library.

**Thoughts**: I deviated away from FreeCodeCamp and started to experiment with Go, simply because it is a tool that I may have to start using professionally. I should preface that I've written some code in Go, but this was....7 months ago or so when I was really dedicated to coding, so at this point, it is like starting over rather than a refresher. I am thinking I'll alternate between work on Python and Go just because I feel like there's a use it or lose it kind of mentality.

It was a guided process but it was nice to go through this setup and have a solid foundation. I look forward to diving into it further.
