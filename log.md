**Today's Progress**: Concluded the HTML/HTML5 portion of the FreeCodeCamp and started the CSS portion.

**Thoughts:** I've touched HTML in the past but it was so long ago and I didn't have the kind of crystal clarity I have with it now. We went through really fast and it's the kind of thing where if I'm making my own page, I may have to reference some of the style guides as far as putting in the tags.

As far as CSS, I started adding different properties to my element and created classes. I just touched on creating ids, but will pick that up more tomorrow. I'm unsure as to what the use of IDs are compared to classes, and why I'd ever use IDs specifically.

Not sure if I can link the FCC stuff here, but I'll work on that.
