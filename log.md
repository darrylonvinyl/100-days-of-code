**Today's Progress**: Concluded the HTML/HTML5 portion of the FreeCodeCamp and started the CSS portion.

**Thoughts:** I've touched HTML in the past but it was so long ago and I didn't have the kind of crystal clarity I have with it now. We went through really fast and it's the kind of thing where if I'm making my own page, I may have to reference some of the style guides as far as putting in the tags.

Not sure if I can link the FCC stuff here, but I'll work on that.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
